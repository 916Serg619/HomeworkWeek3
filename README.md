# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Summary
For this project, I had to create a password generator using HTML, CSS, and mostly, Javascript.  

## How it Works
Open in Browser.  A user will click the red button that says "Generate Password".  From there, a series of prompts will appear, asking the user to specify how the password will be generated. 

User will be asked to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters.  From there, the user will be asked to confirm if special characters, lower case, and upper case letters will be included. Once the selections have been chosen, the generator will return a randomized password back in to the textbox, as well as console logged.

If the user some how cancels on all options presented, an alert will display, and the page will immediately refresh, allowing the user to try again.  

Screenshots are references to different variations and outcomes.

Youtube.com and W3Schools.com were used as guides to help discover a few commands.  Also used as a reference for other uses of some specific functions.

Majority of the education actually came from a programmer by the name of Jamie Rachel Morris.  Her template of the Password Generator served as a great tool to understand almost everything that we have covered from the last week or so.  Very similar to how I initially was going to write and organize my code, but her template had more of a clear lay out, and ultimately, I wouldn't have been able to understand some of the subtle nuances of JavaScript (knowing when and where to declare a variable, for example).  I owe her most of the credit to the completion of this project, and I did gain a ton of knowledge in the process.
